## Steps for using Redux
* Design the store:
    * What is the data store schema
    * what information to keep
* Define the actions
* Define the reducer
* Setup the store based on the reducer
    * Create the store object and link the reducer
    * Subscribe the UI elements to the store to get notified when the store is changed
