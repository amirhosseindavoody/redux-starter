This is the code generated by following the [Redux course by Mosh Hamedani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poQXNp9ItL4)

## Steps for using Redux
* Design the store:
    * What is the data store schema
    * what information to keep
* Define the actions
    * Functions that return an object with fields `type` and `payload`
* Define the reducer
    * A function in the form of `reducer(state, action) => updated_state`
* Setup the store based on the reducer
    * Create the store object and link the reducer
    * Subscribe the UI elements to the store to get notified when the store is changed

## Redux workflow
* We can use `dispatch` function to invoke actions.
* The invoked action will trigger the `reducer` function to get the updated state.
* The UI elements that are subscribed will be updated based on the new state.
